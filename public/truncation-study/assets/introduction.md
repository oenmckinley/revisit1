# Introduction

<p style="font-size: 13px">We invite you to participate in a research study being conducted by investigators from Washington University in St. Louis. The purpose of the study is to understand how the design of a visualization affects readability.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px">If you agree to participate, we would like you to answer several questions about the following visualizations. We would like to use the data we are obtaining in this study for studies going on right now as well as studies that are conducted in the future.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px">These studies may provide additional information that will be helpful in developing better visual communication tools. It is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will have a direct benefit to you. There are no plans to provide financial compensation to you should this occur.

<p style="font-size: 13px">We will share your data with other researchers. They may be doing research in areas similar to this research or in other unrelated areas. These researchers may be at Washington University, at other research centers and institutions, or industry sponsors of research. We may also share your research data with large data repositories (a repository is a database of information) for broad sharing with the research community. If your individual research data is placed in one of these repositories only qualified researchers, who have received prior approval from individuals that monitor the use of the data, will be able to look at your information.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px">Your data will be stored without your name or any other kind of link that would enable us to identify which data are yours. Therefore, it will be available indefinitely for use in future research studies without your additional consent and cannot be removed.</p>
